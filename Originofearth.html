			<h3>Earth Is at the Center and That’s the Truth</h3>
			<p>Here’s a fact, when you go outside early in the morning, you would see that the Sun rose in the east, and then after some time it would set at the west. To us, sitting here on the surface of Earth, geocentrism is a perfectly valid frame of reference. It is our experience, and so this is our reality.<br>
NASA has been brainwashing us, instilling us their so-called “technological advancements” and “discoveries” which were pure lies.<br>
Not convinced?
What if I tell you that the great father of modern Science, Isaac Newton himself believed that the Geocentric model was viable scientifically?<br>
Newton himself wrote on this unpublished “Proposition 43” that in order for the Earth to be at rest in the center of the system of the Sun, Planets, and Comets, there is required both universal gravity and another force in addition that acts on all bodies equally according to the quantity of matter in each of them and is equal and opposite to the accelerative gravity with which the Earth tends to the Sun.<br>
Since this force is equal and opposite to its gravity toward the Sun, the Earth can truly remain in equilibrium between these two forces and be at rest. And thus celestial bodies can move around the Earth at rest.
Notice that Newton specifies that there must be “another force…that acts on all bodies equally.” Well, that “force” appears to be “Dark Matter.” That universal “force” acts upon every celestial body and keeps them in their daily rotation around the fixed Earth.<br>
Scientists today can even confirm that dark matter may account for the unexplained motions of stars within galaxies.
There are without doubt scientific evidences to support geocentrism, what more do you want?<br>
Point to be taken, you should not believe immediately what NASA says to you. After all, they are unreliable and a fraud agency full of criticisms, known to release space images that are actually just been captured in a prepared studio.<br>
And how does it feel to be fooled for so many years?<br>
Even the Biblical scriptures appear to show some accuracies that support the idea that Earth is at the center of the universe, and all celestial bodies revolve around it.<br>
Psalm 104:5 He set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be moved.<br>
Psalm 93:1 The LORD reigns; he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed; he has put on strength as his belt. Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved.<br>
1 Chronicles 16:30 Tremble before him, all the earth; yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved.
Ecclesiastes 1:5 The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises.<br>
You see, truth is just a matter of perspectives, there is no unique definition for any kind of truth, anyone can judge a thing for himself as a truth. As far as we know, we perceive the Sun and all celestial bodies revolving around us, and that is our absolute truth.
