<h1> Mystery: How did it all begin? </h1>
<h3>WHEN the curtain came up on the universe, the lights stayed down for a moment. For about the first 380,000 years, a mere instant on the cosmic stage, charged particles buffeted light around the early universe as if in an opaque fog, and not a glimmer escaped. Then things cooled enough for atoms to form, scattering ceased â€“ and light was liberated.</h3>
